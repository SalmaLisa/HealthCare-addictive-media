              The medical website is a ‘hub’ or main interface integrated with
              other touchpoints. It means capturing the traffic and interest of
              users and directing them to your company website page. We help you
              integrate multiple channels with your medical website and perform
              analytical setups to track data to understand the performance of
              different channels and make optimisation decisions.
